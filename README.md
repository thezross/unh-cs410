<h2> zae1.c </h2>
This program will print out the volume of a box, cylinder, and a frustum.
<h2> zae2.c </h2>
Prompt with program menu then calculate frustum input, icosahedron input, or quit. 
<h2> zae2.c </h2>
This program repeadly prompts for and reads in a floating point number (type double) followed by an integer (type int) until the entered integer is less than or equal to zero.  The first number is the value at which we are taking the approximation (a floating point(radians)).  The second value is an integer indicating how many terms to use in the approximation.  The program will end if the integer is not greater than zero.  If it is, it is calculated. 
<h2> zae4.c </h2>
The program repeatedly reads in an integer (type int) and floating point numbers (type double).  The integer selects the calculation type.  If a delta is entered less then zero, then it is assigned .0001.  If an integer is anything other then one, two, or three, then it is not aknowledged for that loop.

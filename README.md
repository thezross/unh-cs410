<h2> zae1.c </h2>
This program will print out the volume of a box, cylinder, and a frustum.
<h2> zae2.c </h2>
Prompt with program menu then calculate frustum input, icosahedron input, or quit. 
<h2> zae4.c </h2>
The program repeatedly reads in an integer (type int) and floating point numbers (type double).  The integer selects the calculation type.  If a delta is entered less then zero, then it is assigned .0001.  If an integer is anything other then one, two, or three, then it is not aknowledged for that loop.

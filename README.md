<h2> zae1.c </h2>
This program will print out the volume of a box, cylinder, and a frustum.
<h2> zae2.c </h2>
Prompt with program menu then calculate frustum input, icosahedron input, or quit. 
<h2> zae3.c </h2>
This program repeadly prompts for and reads in a floating point number (type double) followed by an integer (type int) until the entered integer is less than or equal to zero.  The first number is the value at which we are taking the approximation (a floating point(radians)).  The second value is an integer indicating how many terms to use in the approximation.  The program will end if the integer is not greater than zero.  If it is, it is calculated. 
<h2> zae4.c </h2>
The program repeatedly reads in an integer (type int) and floating point numbers (type double).  The integer selects the calculation type.  If a delta is entered less then zero, then it is assigned .0001.  If an integer is anything other then one, two, or three, then it is not aknowledged for that loop.     
<h2> zae5.c </h2>
This program find the roots of a function, that is, given a function to find a value of x where f(x)=0.  The bisection method is the root-finding algorithm used to find the roots of functions (approximating) the root of a function.  Several functions will carry out these needs.  
<h2> zae6.c </h2>
Reads floating point numbers into an array and performs some simple statistics on the array (mean, variance, standard deviation).  
<h2> zae7.c </h2>
An acoustal signal can be converted into an electrical signal by a microphone and the electrical signal can then be converted into a series of numbers representing the value of the electrical signal at discrete time intervals.  These values have been stored in a data file, and the program analyzes the data to measure various aspects of the acoustal signal.
<h2> zae8.c </h2>
The scenario is a heat-flow simulation of the transfer of heat from two sides of a metal plate across the entire plate.  A metal plate begins at a pair of fixed temperatures.  Heater/Cooler A is placed up against the top left (north and west) sides of the plate.  Heater/Cooler B is placed up against the bottom and right (south and east) sides of the plate.  The plate itself starts at two initial temperatures: T1 and T2.  As the simulation starts, the sides of the plate will begin to heat up and thus take on temperatures closer to the heaters.  This transfer of heat will contine across the plate until it reaches a "stable" temperature, where stable is defined, roughly, as "not changing significantly".
